<p>Co-operative Technologists (aka CoTech) is a network of co-operatives that sell tech/digital services. It aims to
    create a better technology sector in the UK that focuses primarily on worker, customer and end-user needs rather
    than on generating private profit.</p>
<p>The members of the network aim to use their collective experience, skills, resources and knowledge to radically
    increase the market share of companies that are owned and run by their workers. We have found that this model
    creates better workplaces, better digital products and better value for customers. We want to help more people to
    enjoy the benefits of this model.</p>
<p>Each member of the network is a company that is owned and democratically run by it’s workers (and, in some cases,
    customers). There are no private shareholders who take money out of the company and/or direct the company’s
    activities. While many of the member co-operatives do not have completely flat structures – many have boards,
    management committees, etc. – they are all democratic workplaces and the members have the opportunity to appoint
    people to roles or change the structure of their organisations.</p>
<p>Governance of the network currently takes place through a rough consensus process using <a
        href="https://www.loomio.org/g/oVwtKDOn/digital-co-ops">Loomio</a>, <a href="https://wiki.coops.tech/">a
    wiki</a> and <a href="https://community.coops.tech/">a community forum</a>, and all members are invited and
    encouraged to get involved. As the network develops, we will explore changes to this governance model together.</p>
<p>The network was founded at <a href="https://wiki.coops.tech/wiki/Main_Page#Wortley_Hall_2016">an event on 14th
    November 2016</a> at <a href="https://www.wortleyhall.org.uk/">Wortley Hall – the worker’s stately home</a> – where
    many of us met for the very first time to share ideas, skills and plans for world domination.</p>

<p>Membership of the Co-operative Technologists network is open to all co-ops that sell technical/digital products or
    services that are run and owned by their workers.</p>
<p>Secondary co-ops and multi-stakeholder co-ops are also welcome so long as all they (and their members) do not
    generate money for investors by exploiting their workers.</p>
<p>We refer to these as tech co-ops, though many of us are focused mainly on design or film-making, for example. There
    are many ways to get involved depending where you’re coming from.</p>
<h4>Existing tech co-ops</h4>
<p>If you are already part of a tech co-op (or an organisation that is practising cooperative principles and in the
    process of formally becoming a co-op) then we’ve already tried to find you to invite you to the network.</p>
<p>If you were hiding somewhere or missed our call then get in touch.</p>
<h4>Existing tech/digital companies</h4>
<p>If you are part of a company or social enterprise that sells digital services and would be interested in becoming a
    workers co-op then we’re here to help.</p>
<p>We have found that co-operatives are more democratic, effective and fun to work for than other structures such as
    social enterprises, partnerships and traditional companies. If you’d like to find out why then get in touch.</p>
<p>Once you’re on the path to becoming a co-op you can become a member of the network.</p>
<h4>Individuals that want to work for tech co-ops</h4>
<p>If you are an individual that would like to work for a tech co-op then you can either apply for a job at an existing
    member co-op or start your own.</p>
<p>To apply for a job you can contact us or individually explaining about your skills/experience
    and why you want to work for a tech co-op.</p>
<p>The majority of jobs in our network are for developers, designers, project managers, etc. but if you have some skills
    you think we need then let us know. If you would like to start a tech co-op then we’d love to help you.</p>
<p>There are many types of co-op that are eligible for membership of Co-operative Technologists including worker
    co-operatives, freelancer co-ops and various types of consortium co-ops. We can share our various models with you
    and you can pick one you like and adapt it to your needs.</p>
<p>Co-operatives in the UK take various legal forms including companies limited by shares, companies limited by
    guarantee, co-operative and mutual societies, partnerships and unincorporated bodies. All are eligible for
    membership of Co-operative Technologists.</p>
<h4>Individuals that don’t want to work for tech co-ops</h4>
<p>If you are interested in what we’re doing and would like to support our efforts but do not want to join or start a
    tech co-op then you will soon be able to become an official supporter of Co-operative Technologists.</p>
<p>We’re still working our exactly what this entails but in essence you will provide support of some kind and in return
    will be invited to events, given opportunities to feed into the network and receive support where we can offer
    it.</p>
<p>If you’d like to find out more and help shape this official supporter role then please get in touch. You can also
    read more about us and check out our manifesto. You can join our <a href="https://community.coops.tech">online forum</a> read more <a href="/about">about us</a> and check out
